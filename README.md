# 👋 Hi, I am Silvio

I work at the intersection of **business analysis**, **data**, and **culture**.  
I enjoy turning messy information into clear decisions — and writing about how policy, history, wine, and cinema shape the world we live in.

## 💼 Business Analysis

> Selected, anonymised projects developed at Ralph Lauren (EMEA).  
> Each card follows: **Problem → Solution → Result**.

### 1) Market Tracker Dashboard
- **Problem**: Commercial and merchandising teams needed a single view of **sell-in / sell-out** and **market performance** across countries and seasons.  
- **Solution**: Built a **Power BI** dashboard with country filters, dynamic period comparisons, and category drill-downs. Automated refresh via **Power Query**.  
- **Result**: Reduced weekly reporting time by ~**70%** and aligned discussions around one source of truth.  
- **Stack**: Power BI, Power Query, Excel  
- **Media**: _Add a redacted screenshot here_  
  `![Market Tracker](./images/market-tracker.png)`

### 2) Deliveries Tracker
- **Problem**: Fragmented visibility on **PO deliveries** vs **store floorset dates** created last-minute firefighting.  
- **Solution**: A tracker that reconciled ERP exports with planning calendars, flagged risks, and emailed exceptions.  
- **Result**: Earlier risk detection; fewer escalations before floorsets.  
- **Stack**: Power Query, Excel (Power Pivot), VBA (optional)  
- **Media**:  
  `![Deliveries Tracker](./images/deliveries-tracker.png)`

### 3) Assortment Scorecard
- **Problem**: Needed a quick way to evaluate **assortment breadth** and **depth** by account vs design intent.  
- **Solution**: Scorecard with configurable **KPIs**, traffic-light thresholds, and PDF one-pagers.  
- **Result**: Faster adoption reviews and clearer cross-team alignment.  
- **Stack**: Power BI, DAX, Excel  
- **Media**:

## 📰 Borderliner

**Borderliner** is my independent newsletter on **economics, history, policy, wine, and cinema**.  
- 🔗 Read & subscribe: **[Add your Substack link]**  
- 🧩 What I explore: incentives, institutions, and the trade-offs behind “progress”.  
- 🧵 Recent pieces (curated):
  - *Embrace the Suck* — ESG impact and why real change has a cost.  
  - *The Triple Lock (and other British amenities)* — UK fiscal design and inequality.  
  - *Bosnia’s Federation* — institutions, vetoes, and the High Representative.  

> I aim to make complex topics readable without simplifying away the mechanisms that matter.

## 🎬 Cinema

Film is how I test ideas about **identity, power, and memory** — then write short reviews.

- 🎞 Letterboxd: **[Add your Letterboxd profile link]**  
- 🧠 Current threads: box-ing as a metaphor, urban loneliness, and political cinema.  
- ✍️ Occasional cross-posts into Borderliner when themes overlap.

### Colophon
This page is deliberately split between **professional outputs** (Business Analysis) and **intellectual projects** (Borderliner, Cinema, Sommelier), because both inform how I work.
